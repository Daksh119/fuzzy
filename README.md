# Choquet Fuzzy Integral-Based Classifier Ensemble for COVID-19 Detection

This project implements a Choquet fuzzy integral-based ensemble classifier for detecting COVID-19. It is based on the methodology presented in the research paper: "Choquet fuzzy integral-based classifier ensemble technique for COVID-19 detection."

## Project Overview

The aim is to develop an ensemble model combining multiple classifiers using the Choquet fuzzy integral. This approach allows for optimal aggregation of classifier outputs, improving prediction accuracy for COVID-19 detection from medical data.

## Features

- Multiple base classifiers (e.g., SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.)
- Choquet fuzzy integral as an aggregation method
- Implementation of a fuzzy measure for classifier weights
- Evaluation on a COVID-19 dataset (to be decided)
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

## To-Do List

1. **Literature Review**:
   - Study Choquet fuzzy integral and related fuzzy set theory concepts.
   - Explore other ensemble techniques to draw comparisons.
   
2. **Dataset Selection**:
   - Find and pre-process a COVID-19 dataset suitable for classification tasks (e.g., chest X-rays, lab results, etc.).
   - Clean and normalize the dataset.

3. **Base Classifiers**:
   - Implement or integrate multiple base classifiers such as:
     - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
     - Decision Trees
     - Random Forests
     - Neural Networks
   - Train classifiers individually on the dataset.

4. **Choquet Fuzzy Integral Implementation**:
   - Implement the Choquet fuzzy integral aggregation method.
   - Define and calculate fuzzy measures (λ-measure, Sugeno λ-measure, etc.) for each classifier.

5. **Model Ensemble**:
   - Combine base classifiers using the Choquet fuzzy integral.
   - Optimize the aggregation process through tuning fuzzy measures.

6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Test the ensemble model on the dataset.
   - Compare results with individual classifiers and other ensemble techniques.

7. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Calculate and report accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score for the model.
   - Visualize results using confusion matrices and ROC curves.

8. **Documentation**:
   - Write detailed documentation explaining the implementation.
   - Add comments to the codebase for clarity.

9. **Future Work**:
   - Experiment with different datasets.
   - Implement additional fuzzy integral variants or improve the current approach.
